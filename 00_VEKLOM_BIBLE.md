# 00 — VEKLOM BIBLE — READ FIRST

**Mandatory context for every human or AI working in this repo.** Canonical operational source: `reprewindai-dev/veklom-ops-command/00_VEKLOM_BIBLE.md`.

Veklom is the sovereign AI **capability control plane / runtime authority layer**. It governs capability, not a permanent fleet of privileged agents.

Lifecycle: `Resolve → Bind policy/authority → Issue scoped grant → Instantiate ephemeral runtime → Execute → Record evidence → Revoke → Destroy → Observe/Settle`.

Truth order: **live behavior → Coolify runtime → GitHub default branch → verified PGL evidence → docs**. Demo/seeded/synthetic output is never production proof.

RepoGate owns repository/capability intake, findings, risk classification, policy/security gating, and RepoGate-local evidence. Consequential follow-on authority belongs at the governed authorization boundary; canonical evidence sealing belongs to PGL/Gnomledger.

RepoGate may be sold as a standalone product. Inside Capability OS, reuse its scanning/gating capabilities and build a Veklom-native surface rather than embedding the standalone UI.

GitHub is source truth; Coolify is deployment truth. Use Coolify UI/API for management; SSH only for direct host/container verification/ops. Internal ports `3000`/`8000` are valid behind Traefik; the old blanket prohibition is retired. Never commit secrets or hard-code ephemeral runtime IDs.

Use evidence labels `VERIFIED_LIVE`, `VERIFIED_REPO`, `CONFIGURED`, `LAST_KNOWN`, `TARGET`, `UNVERIFIED`, `DEMO`, `ARCHIVED`. This Bible supersedes older Golden Bible, agent-alignment, topology, deployment-authority, and port-doctrine docs wherever they conflict.
